A repository for automatically using the latest chainlink repo from the core chainlink repo.

> IMPORTANT
### As of 1.2.0 and onward all the releases of this package are going to match the [@chainlink/contracts NPM tags](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts)
### So it will look "backwards", but we are starting with 0.2.1
